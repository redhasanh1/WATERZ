    <p>The Service may integrate with or link to third-party services. Those services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. WatermarkAI is not responsible for third-party acts, omissions, or content. When using third-party integrations, you must ensure compliance with U.S. and Canadian regulations that apply to your industry.</p>

    <h2>11. Compliance with Laws</h2>
    <p>You agree to comply with all applicable laws, including copyright, neighboring rights, database rights, consumer protection, advertising standards, export controls, and sanctions regulations in the jurisdictions where you operate.

    <h2>13. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WATERMARKAI DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

    <h2>16. Export and Sanctions Compliance</h2>
    <p>The Service may be subject to Canadian and U.S. export control and sanctions laws.

For customers located in the United States, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, excluding its conflict of law rules, and disputes may be brought in the state or federal courts located in Delaware. If local consumer law grants you additional mandatory protections or dispute forums, those rights remain unaffected.</p>

    <h2>18. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may revise these Terms to reflect changes in law, technology, or Service features. Material changes will be announced via the Service or by email. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must discontinue use.</p>
